# 🧪 Automated Testing Setup Complete!

## 📋 What Was Implemented

Comprehensive automated testing framework for the Calendar Scheduler Agent project. Here's what was created:

### 🏗️ Testing Infrastructure
- **`pytest.ini`** - Pytest configuration with markers, coverage settings, and test discovery
- **`requirements-test.txt`** - All testing dependencies including pytest, coverage, mocking, and linting tools
- **`tests/conftest.py`** - Pytest fixtures and configuration for consistent test setup
- **`tests/test_framework.py`** - Base test classes and utilities for easier test development

### 🎯 Test Suites
- **`tests/unit/`** - Unit tests for individual components:
  - `test_calendar_service.py` - Tests for calendar service functionality
  - `test_mcp_client.py` - Tests for MCP client components
  - `test_permissions.py` - Tests for the permission system
  - `test_evaluation.py` - Tests for the evaluation system
- **`tests/integration/`** - Integration tests:
  - `test_agent_workflow.py` - End-to-end workflow testing
- **`tests/fixtures/`** - Test data and fixtures:
  - `test_data.py` - Sample events, rooms, users, and mock responses

### 🛠️ Development Tools
- **`run_tests.py`** - Comprehensive test runner with multiple options
- **`Makefile`** - 50+ commands for development, testing, and maintenance
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### 📊 Test Categories & Markers
- `unit` - Unit tests
- `integration` - Integration tests  
- `smoke` - Smoke tests
- `azure` - Tests requiring Azure services
- `mcp` - MCP client tests
- `permissions` - Permission system tests
- `evaluation` - Evaluation system tests
- `slow` - Long-running tests

## 🚀 Next Steps - How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Option 1: Using pip
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Option 2: Using make
make install-dev

# Option 3: Complete setup with virtual environment
make setup
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test
# or
python run_tests.py --all

# Run specific test types
make test-unit          # Unit tests only
make test-integration   # Integration tests only
make test-smoke         # Smoke tests only

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific test file
python run_tests.py --test tests/unit/test_calendar_service.py

# Run tests with specific marker
python run_tests.py --marker unit
```

### 3. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks
make check-all

# Individual checks
make format          # Format code with black
make lint           # Run linting with ruff
make type-check     # Run type checking with mypy

# Auto-fix issues
make format lint-fix
```

### 4. Development Workflow
```bash
# Quick development check
make dev-check

# Complete quality check
make full-check

# Set up pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit-install

# Run full test suite
make test-full
```

### 5. Available Make Commands
```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make status         # Show project status
make clean          # Clean temporary files
make env-info       # Show environment information
```
