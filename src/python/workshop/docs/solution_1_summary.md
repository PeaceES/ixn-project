# Solution 1: User Context Injection - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete!

Solution 1 has been successfully implemented. Here's how it works:

## Overview

The system automatically injects user context for authenticated web users when they send booking-related messages, eliminating the need to ask for user IDs.

## Key Components

### 1. Web Server (`web_server.py`)
- **Feature Flag**: `AUTO_INJECT_USER_CONTEXT` environment variable (default: `true`)
- **Authentication Check**: Verifies user is logged in before injecting context
- **Keyword Detection**: Identifies booking-related messages
- **Context Injection**: Prepends user information to qualifying messages

### 2. Agent Instructions (`general_instructions.txt`)
- **Context Recognition**: Agent checks for `[System: User context - ...]` prefix
- **Smart Behavior**: Uses provided ID when available, asks when not
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with both context-aware and regular messages

## How It Works

### Terminal Interface (Unchanged)
```
User: I want to book a room
Agent: What's your user ID?
User: 5
Agent: Let me check what you can book for...
```

### Web Interface (Enhanced)
```
User: I want to book a room
[System automatically injects: ID: 5, Name: John Doe, Email: john@example.com]
Agent: I see you're John Doe (ID: 5). Let me check what you can book for...
```

## Booking Keywords

Messages containing these keywords trigger context injection:
- book, schedule, reserve
- meeting, event, room
- calendar, available
- "what can i book"

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Feature
```bash
# Enable (default)
export AUTO_INJECT_USER_CONTEXT=true

# Disable (web behaves like terminal)
export AUTO_INJECT_USER_CONTEXT=false
```

## Security Features

1. **Server-Side Only**: Context injection happens on the server, preventing client-side spoofing
2. **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in users get context injection
3. **Clear Format**: System messages use a distinct format that users can't replicate
4. **Selective Injection**: Only booking-related messages get context

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Test context parsing and keyword detection
python test_user_context.py

# See integration examples
python test_integration.py
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Terminal Mode**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # Type: I want to book a room
   # Agent will ask for your ID
   ```

2. **Web Mode**:
   - Start web server: `python web_server.py`
   - Login with any email from org_structure.json
   - Start agent
   - Type: "I want to book a room"
   - Agent will know who you are automatically

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Web users don't need to provide ID repeatedly
2. **Seamless**: Works transparently without changing conversation flow
3. **Flexible**: Can be disabled if needed
4. **Secure**: Prevents identity spoofing
5. **Compatible**: Terminal usage remains unchanged

## Code Changes Summary

1. **web_server.py**:
   - Added `AUTO_INJECT_USER_CONTEXT` configuration
   - Modified `handle_send_message()` to inject context
   - Enhanced authentication handling for WebSocket events

2. **general_instructions.txt**:
   - Added context recognition instructions
   - Updated booking flow to handle both scenarios

3. **agent_core.py** (optional enhancement):
   - Added support for environment variables (for future use)
   - Can read default user context if needed

## Conclusion

Solution 1 successfully bridges the gap between terminal testing and web production usage, providing an enhanced user experience while maintaining backward compatibility and security.
